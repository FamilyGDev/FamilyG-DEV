# esx_aircraftshop
Aircraft Shop based on ESX

I did NOT create the Code. I only edited the esx_vehicleshop code to create this new shop. This code unlike most other versions out there do NOT interfere with the Original esx_vehicleshop.

This Aircraft Shop works just like esx_vehicleshop. However tho instead of Players buying Cars they can Buy/Sell Aircrafts. I created this because i couldn't find a Aircraft Shop Script & instead of waiting for others i went ahead & did it myself. 

The personal aircraft menu can be opened with /pa (like the vehicle shop /pv command).
